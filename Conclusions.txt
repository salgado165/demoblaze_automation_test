API TEST

Functional testing was performed for both API and UI using Cypress.

On API testing, the responses did not return any status other than 200,
for that reason validations were made through the body structure and
error messages.

API login tests were added using wrong username, wrong password, both
wrong and both correct, in order to cover different scenarios.


UI Automation Test

A complete flow was added from selecting items, adding them to the cart,
completing the purchase and displaying the successful message, including
browser alerts.


Conclusion

Functional testing was successfully implemented for both API
